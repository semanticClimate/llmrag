# LLMRAG Session Log: Environment Fixes and Testing
**Date:** July 2, 2025  
**Duration:** Extended session  
**Focus:** Python environment issues, dependency management, testing, and system improvements

## Session Overview

This session focused on resolving critical Python environment and dependency issues that were preventing the LLMRAG system from running properly. The main challenges were:

1. **Python version conflicts** between 3.8 and 3.12
2. **Type hint compatibility** issues with modern Python syntax
3. **Dependency installation** in wrong environments
4. **Streamlit caching** and environment conflicts
5. **Testing framework** setup and validation
6. **UI improvements** for team testing

## Key Issues Identified

### 1. Python Environment Confusion
- User was running Python 3.12 but some dependencies were installed in Python 3.8 site-packages
- Virtual environment wasn't properly activated
- Mixed Python versions caused type hint errors (`'type' object is not subscriptable`)

### 2. Type Hint Compatibility
- Modern type hints like `list[str]` not compatible with Python 3.8
- ChromaDB and other dependencies had incompatible type hints
- Needed to use `List[str]` with proper imports from `typing`

### 3. Dependency Management
- ChromaDB installed in wrong Python environment
- Missing `langchain_core.schema` module
- Inconsistent package installations across environments

### 4. Streamlit Environment Issues
- Streamlit running from wrong Python environment
- Caching issues preventing proper environment detection
- Multiple port attempts due to environment conflicts

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Environment Cleanup and Setup
- **Deleted old virtual environment** (`venv`) that was causing conflicts
- **Activated correct environment** (`venv_py312`) with Python 3.12
- **Reinstalled all dependencies** in the correct environment
- **Installed package in development mode** (`pip install -e .`)

### 2. Type Hint Fixes
- **Fixed all type hints** across multiple files:
  - `llmrag/embeddings/sentence_transformers_embedder.py`
  - `llmrag/retrievers/chroma_store.py`
  - `llmrag/chunking/html_splitter.py`
  - `llmrag/models/transformers_model.py`
  - `llmrag/pipelines/rag_pipeline.py`
- **Added proper imports** from `typing` module
- **Replaced modern syntax** with compatible alternatives

### 3. Device Detection Improvements
- **Enhanced device detection** in `ChapterRAG` class
- **Added macOS version checking** for MPS compatibility
- **Implemented robust fallback** to CPU when GPU unavailable
- **Fixed MPS device issues** on macOS versions before 14.0

### 4. Section-Aware Retrieval Enhancement
- **Improved retrieval logic** for section-specific queries
- **Added metadata filtering** based on paragraph IDs
- **Enhanced RAG pipeline prompts** for better section handling
- **Tested with section queries** like "What is the title of the introduction (10.1)?"

### 5. UI Improvements for Team Testing
- **Cascading chapter selection** organized by working group
